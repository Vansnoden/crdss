Here's a structured extraction of knowledge triples from the provided text.  Note that some triples are implicit and require inference from the text's context.  The relationships are often not explicitly stated, so I've chosen appropriate semantic relationships based on the context.

This is not an exhaustive list, as many more triples could be derived, particularly relating to specific agricultural practices and their respective environmental impacts.  However, it provides a strong foundation for knowledge representation from the given text.
